<h3>GUI vs CLI</h3> 
</header>
<div class="w3-container">
<p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) are two different ways that someone can see and manipulate files and such on computers or workspaces. GUIs are more visual (think files and folders on your desktop, while CLIs are lines of code and words that can be manipulated. CLIs are much quicker to manipulate and change while GUIs take more time to change and they have more information. A short way to describe the difference is visual vs text.</p>

        <h3>Learning Styles</h3>

<div class="w3-container">
    <p>Learning styles effects how each of us learns uniquely and individually. Some of us learn better by getting our hands on something and doing trial and error, while others learn best by watching someone else and then attempting themselves. While there are three main learning styles, visual, tactile, and audible, people can have learning styles that are any combination of those or even certain techniques that works for them outside of that scope. For example, I learn more by getting my hands on something and doing trail and error or by watching someone do it, but my husband learns best by listening. </p>
