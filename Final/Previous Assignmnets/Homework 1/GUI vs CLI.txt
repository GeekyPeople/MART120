Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI) are two different ways that someone can see and manipulate files and such on computers or workspaces. GUIs are more visual (think files and folders on your desktop, while CLIs are lines of code and words that can be manipulated. CLIs are much quicker to manipulate and change while GUIs take more time to change and they have more information. A short way to describe the difference is visual vs text.
