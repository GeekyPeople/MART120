Learning styles effects how each of us learns uniquely and individually. Some of us learn better by getting our hands on something and doing trial and error, while others learn best by watching someone else and then attempting themselves. While there are three main learning styles, visual, tactile, and audible, people can have learning styles that are any combination of those or even certain techniques that works for them outside of that scope. For example, I learn more by getting my hands on something and doing trail and error or by watching someone do it, but my husband learns best by listening.
