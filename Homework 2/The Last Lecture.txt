Captain Kirk - Its really cool to meet your childhood idle, but its also really cool when they come to you to see what cool stuff you've done.

Never loose the childlike wonder

what affected you the most? Did you identify with any of his messages?

	The thing that affected me the most was the ending of the lecture, after watching him go through his childhood dreams, how he enabled the dreams of others, and his lessons learned, how he demonstrated the head fakes of his lecture, the most import one being how the lecture was for his kids. The lecture had a lot of important life lessons and take aways that would be great for anyone to watch, but dedicating it to his children must have been very important to them as they watched it later on, as well as special to have a piece of their dads story that they can look back on. You could tell he truly cared about his family and the people around him. I identified with plenty of his messages, writing down the t=most impactful takeaways that I had from watching his lecture. Its inspiring how despite him not having much time left, Randy wanted to spread important messages and hold something special for his wife and kids to remember him by. Watching this years later is interesting to see how far that technology has come, and how his wants of wanting to spread that message can be seen even today.
