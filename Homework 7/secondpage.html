       <div class="w3-container w3-gray"> <span>Aerilaya Maireith is my current dungeons and dragons character who has been through a lot both on her own and with the party.
        Aeri grew up in a farming town, but spent most of her time in the forest nearby.
        She spent so much time in this forest, she became one with the forest and its creatures. Adopted by both spirit and creature alike.
        The guardian spirit of the forest, in the form of a bright rainbow stag, especially looked after her. </span> </div> <br>
